# Baseball Advanced Statistics

### Description
This project provides the formulas to calculate multiple advanced baseball statistics like wOBA, wRAA, wRC, ISO, BABIP, FIP, WHIP. 
The formulas have been applied to 2020 Spanish Division de Honor League Stats. 

Using these formulas, I have created a Streamlit app that displays the advance statistics and allows the user to interact with the data, filter the players and compare their stats.
